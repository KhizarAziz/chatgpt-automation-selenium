# chatgpt-automation-selenium
This project is to access chatgpt in browser, execute a few statements, get answers and write to a text file.


Everything is working fine. just run the playground.py script. it will get a response from chatgpt.




### TBD
* Submit button's ID is changing, do something about it! 
* Currently only works with chrome closed. I need to solve it:
    * By connecting to currently running chrome instance (Seems not possible so far)
    * OR by switching from Chrome to Firefox
    * Or anything else....
